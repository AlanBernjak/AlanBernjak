- This is the data repository including Matlab code and data used in the original research article entitled ‘Hypoglycaemia combined with mild hypokalaemia reduces the heart rate and causes abnormal pacemaker activity in a computational model of a human sinoatrial cell’ by authors Alan Bernjak, Ahmed Iqbal, Simon R Heller and Richard H Clayton from the University of Sheffield.
- The repository includes the code to reproduce the Fabbri SAN model at baseline conditions ‘FabbriHypoModel_v1.m’ as well as the corresponding output structure ‘testFabbri.mat’ and a script to plot the AP waveform ‘plot_Fabbri.m’. A second version of the model ‘FabbriHypoModel_v2.m’ produces 30 sets of randomly selected input parameters Ko, gKr and IVshift and the corresponding outputs, including AP features and AP waveform time series are saved in a Matlab structure ‘testFabbri2.mat’. The corresponding CL data can be displayed using the ‘plot_Fabbri2.m’ script.
- The repository also includes the scripts and corresponding data to reproduce all figures in the article. For each figure, the script and the data are labelled using the figure number. For example, to reproduce Figure1, use script ‘Figure1_mfile’ and this script will load data from the ‘Figure1_data.mat’ file. The scripts for 13 figures and corresponding data are available. Occasionally these scripts or function require additional function to produce the graphs. All such additional functions or script are also included in the repository. For each figure, additional information is given in comments.
